	<p>2018/12/11, thirty-first day in a row</p>
	<h1>A month already</h1>
        <p>The beginning is already shrouded in the past. I faintly remember when I started and what I did then, but only reading the daily notices manages to bring back the memories.</p>
	<h2>So, what have I learned in a month?</h2>
	<p>I'll try to keep the list short and general.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>It's easy to loose track of what you want to accomplish.</li>
	  <li>You tend to try shortcuts and then you get lost.</li>
	  <li>It is hard to go back on track.</li>
	  <li>It is good to find similarly minded people. But it is hard to find them.</li>
	  <li>And they deal with the same issues, so it's not easy to go forward together.</li>
	  <li>Maybe learning on your own is hard because it gets awfully lonely down here.</li>
	</ul>
