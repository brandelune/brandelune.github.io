	<h1>Stuck between a rock...</h1>
        <p>I am stuck where I don't want to be. I want to complete that code and have working templates. But if I pretend it is the most important aspect of my current endeavor then I'll get lost into finicking over "not good enough" when I should be focusing on "good enough". I am using advice from the help.gnu.emacs list regarding the creation of paths, to make sure that I get everything right. But those are functions that I've never used before and they look awfully obscure in the elisp reference.</p>
	<p>The reference does not come with a lot of practical examples. It sometimes introduces examples to illustrate a particular point of the syntax, but for some reason, the points that bite me are not well covered. That seems to indicate not that the reference is incomplete, but rather that my understanding is still too shallow to make proper use of it.</p>
	<p>So, my decision is that I'm putting that code aside for the moment being and resuming work on "front end" stuff. And when I have some time, I can resume working on the code. For now, I'll just copy-paste old files to new directories and edit them by hand.</p>
