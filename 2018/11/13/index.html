	<code>18/11/13, third day in a row</code>
	<h1>三日坊主</h1>
	<p>We use the expression "<ruby>三日坊主<rp> (</rp><rt>ミッカボウズ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>" (three day monk) in Japan for people who can't commit to something for more than a few days. Hopefully, my #10000daysof code will be longer than that...</p>
	<p>Something I did not mention yesterday is that I got the <a href="https://doublet.jp" target="blank">doublet.jp</a> new server up and running. It was hosted by a local provider who was really nice but I decided to rent a server myself to work with all the names I am managing (some bought in Japan, some on gandi.net). Now I have to get used to all the new options. It reminds me when I was telneting the eskimo server back in the days...</p>
	<h2>What I did today</h2>
	<p>I did a lot of rewriting, adding things here and there, testing and reverting. I think I'm ready to go back to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/brandelune" target="blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
	    now.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>First, I added a navigation, I played with flex for its display but for now I don't think I'm going to do anything fancy with it. I added proper "rel" and "hreflang" attributes.</li>
	    <li>I split the css in 3 parts: layout / box / text. You can see it here: <a href="../../../css/2018/adventuresintechland.css" target="blank">adventuresintechland.css</a>. I'll probably be testing a number of patterns there.</li>
	    <li>I tested <code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code> here.</li>
	    <li>In the CSS I also tested attribute selectors and pseudo-elements to add the "&lt;" and "&gt;" in the navigation links only: <code>a[rel=prev]::after {content: " <";}</code>. That's pretty cool, but there are probably issues with accessibility/localization with this.</li>
	    <li>I added a code list to the index for easier reference.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What I need to do</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li class="todo">I need to find a "project" manager for all the files. There must be a mode for that in emacs.</li>
	    <li class="todo">I need to find a way to manage the links in the navigation for the new files. Doing that manually is error prone.</li>
	    <li class="todo">I still have not configured emacs for auto-completion. I liked what they had in Coda, Bluefish is not bad either, but I'm sure there is something for emacs too. For now that's not a big problem, in fact it's better to not use completion since it forces me to type and remember.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>News</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>w3c's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-selectors-3-20181106/" target="blank">Selector level 3</a>
		became a recommendation on November 6.</li>
