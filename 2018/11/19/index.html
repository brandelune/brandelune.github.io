	<p>Yesterday I was exhausted. I went to bed at 11:30 and I slept almost until 9. I remember having dreams. Today I saw an interview with Bernard Stiegler. It was fascinating. I dreamt about it to, but I was in bed at 2 and had to wake up at 8. Tough.</p>
	<h2>What did I do?</h2>
	<p>I wanted to write a script that would automatically create the css index file. I started with command line pipes sending filtered output to sed. After a lot of head scratching and some output simplification I managed to have something working at the command line prompt but not as a script. There was probably an issue with an escape character somewhere but it was late and I decided to stop there. I wrote this update on the 20th, when I did find the solution. So, see you tomorrow!</p>
