	<h1>Practice</h1>
	<p>Yesterday I had a kendo competition. I have not seriously practiced for close to 2 years. The result was, as I joked on twitter, not "不動心" but just "不動". Practice in kendo, at least once a week, two or three times a week is possible, is the only way to improve. Just like writing, just like coding, just like anything I want to become better at.</p>
	<h2>Not much today either</h2>	
	<ul>
	  <li>I forced myself to so some lessons at freeCodeCamp, not much</li>
	  <li>I read a bit more about trigonometric functions</li>
	</ul>
