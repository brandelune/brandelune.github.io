	<h1>Just enough wine</h1>
	<p>Today I had to attend a party as board member of the local Japan-France association. The wine was nice and the people too. I came home late so did not have much time to work.</p>

	<h2>FreeCodeCamp</h2>
	This time, we started working on element positionning.
	<ul>
	    <li><code>position:relative</code> and offset</li>
	    <li><code>position:absolute</code> and offset, depends on its closest positionned parent</li>
	    <li><code>position:fixed</code> and offset</li>
	    <li><code>float</code> </li>
	</ul>

	<p>I was sleepy when I did all that so I guess I'll have to do it again.
