    <p>18/11/21, eleventh day in a row</p>

    <h1>Birthday!</h1>
    <p>I'm 49 today. I've been telling anyone who asks "I'm close to 50" just to getting used to say the number. 49 is just another step in that direction. Hopefully, 365 days from now, I'll be working on cool web sites that will make the kids proud. I had two cakes today too.<p>
      <h2>So, what was the menu today?</h2>	
      <ul>
	<li>I did a huge amount of refactoring today. Now I have a <code>2018</code> folder with 2 sub folders: one for November (<code>11</code>) and one for December (<code>12</code>). Each one of those contains one sub folder per day that has one <code>index.html</code> file.</li>
	<li>There is also a <code>css</code> folder that has all the style sheets, and a <code>code</code> folder where I put all the code/scripts I'll write along the way.</li>
	<li>I'm going to need to write other scripts. One to index the <code>code</code> contents, another one to fill the <code>index.html</code> templates, I'll need to automate the link verification too... Besides for progressing in FreeCodeCamp and creating cool things here too.</li>
</ul>
