	<p>18/11/15, fifth day in a row</p>

	<h1>Islands</h1>
	<p>There is an island, thirty five minutes off the coast by ferry, where I often spend the day. There are only 3 roads and you can walk around it in an hour. There are some places where you can rest, and eat, and talk with the people. Somebody is lending me a house there. Sometimes I stay over. The last ferry comes in before seven pm. After that there is no activity to speak of. I can stay at the kitchen table, silent, without any connection to the rest of the world. No phone, not internet.</p>

	<h2>What I accomplished today</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>Added TODO class to some old items.</li>
	    <li>Created a CSS for each day so that the evolution can be seen and put them all in a <a href="../../../css/index.html">/css</a>
		folder. That also means I can create a totally different CSS each and every day.</li>
	    <li>Applied the <code>box-shadow</code> to the &lt;code&gt; tag and not to the &lt;rt&gt; tag anymore. That was impairing readability of ruby characters.</li>
	    <li>I modified today's CSS.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>FreeCodeCamp</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li><code>text-transform</code></li>
	    <li><code>font-size</code> for headers</li>
	    <li><code>font-weight</code> for headers</li>
	    <li><code>font-size</code> for paragraphs</li>
	    <li><code>line-height</code> for paragraphs</li>
	    <li>adjust hover state of anchor tag (pseudo class <code>a:hover</code>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I found this paper on web-mode, by its author: "<a href="http://web-mode.org/papers/els2014-fxbois-web-mode-el.pdf" target="blank">Heterogeneous recursive code parsing with Emacs Lisp</a>".
