	<p>Progress is slow. But it's what drives my day. I'm waiting for the few hours I have at night to work on freeCodeCamp, to write some code, to read a few articles about such and such web-related technology. It is fun and exciting. Maybe the process of documenting that is even more fun. I could never write every day about translation. Or about translation tools. What's fun about them? Not much. They're just here to make the task easier. They're here to reduce the friction between the job order and the delivery. Learning is about increasing the friction. Web design is too. Increase the friction so much that people stay on your page.</p>
