	<h1>Lots of meta stuff</h1>
	<p>I spent a bit part of the evening rewriting the css index generating file. For some reason it refused to work today. I could not find the reason but I simplified the thing by removing the unnecessary <code>cut</code> command (unnecessary since <code>awk</code> can handle that perfectly well).</p>
	<p>Then I did a small rewrite for the dailyIndex script written in emacs lisp. I wanted to be able to be prompted for a title and a subtitle. It is done now. Also it looks like there is a bug in the <code>format</code>function. It seems like it won't accept <code>%$10s</code> and will interpret it as <code>%$1s</code>... But maybe I'm misunderstanding something.</p>
	<h2>Networking</h2>	
	<p>I am trying to be active on <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a> where I also asked for a mentor. It happens that the person who has been assigned to me is an artist who also does front end. We've exchanged a bit through the dev.to dm system and we agreed on meeting online once a week to work together. Pretty cool :) (ooops, first smiley on this site !!!)</p>
	<h2>Busy</h2>
	<p>I'm going to be busy the 3 coming days, but I'll still try to progress, except that I may not have the time to document the thing right away.</p>
