	<h1>Stars</h1>
        <p>There was an exercise on freeCodeCamp today that was really nice. It was a night sky with stars, and by using animation you had to make the stars twinkle. The exercise is <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/animate-elements-at-variable-rates/" target="blank">here</a>. What I did from that, and I'm surprised that it seems to not exist on the web, is recreate a real constellation with stars also twinkling.</p>
	<h2>How did I do that?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My code is <a href="./stars.html">here</a>. It is plain, trivial and repetitive HTML+CSS.</li>
            <li>I found a picture of the Scorpio constellation <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/scorpio-vector-zodiac-sign-bright-stars-71071804?src=u6fJUPA1zhm9Yvs_r2P1HA-1-13">on the web.</a></li>
	    <li>I opened it in Preview and used the screenshot cursor to find the coordinates of each star relative to the top left screen corner.</li>
	    <li>I recorder all the coordinates while measuring them with the new Voice Memo application on Mojave, and I played myself the recording when I was done to write down the measurements.</li>
	    <li>I used a few quick regex/replacements to create some CSS code for each star, tested, adapted and put the code up here.</li>
	    <li>The CSS itself is trivial, each star comes with individual characteristics and each has a specific animation. I'm thinking to make that for a significant part of the night sky, with cool references appearing when hovering on a star, but that's for a different project.</li>
	    <li>Tomorrow, I'll start working on "Applied Accessibility" in the evening. But in the afternoon I'll be going to a local community center to hear John Kaizan Neptune play...</li>
        </ul>
