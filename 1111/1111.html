    <title>What I learned in the basic html and basic css path</title>
    <style>

      body {
      background-color: #ffffff;
      color: #1a1a1a;
      font-family: sans-serif;
      }

      h1 {
      text-align: center;
      }

      p {
      text-align: justify;
      }

      .important {
      border: 1px solid red;
      }
    </style>

    <h1>What I need to go deeper into:</h1>
    <ul class="important">
      <li>css variables</li>
      <li>media queries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Basically the 2 areas that were covered in the 2 basic paths that I just completed that did not exist in 96 when I started creating web sites.</p>
    <p>The lessons are here: <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org">https://learn.freecodecamp.org</a></p>
    <p>I put 2 notes in emacs regarding those items, with links to W3Schools, for further reference.</p>
    <p>Here are the links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also need to install some kind of autocompletion for html/css on emacs.</p>
    <p>To create this file, I used my "&lt;text file" applescript that does a "touch" on the front Finder window and proposes to open the created file in Emacs. It used to be BBEdit but I modified that today. I'm putting the script here too.</p>
    <p><a href="./&lt;text file.applescript">&lt;text file.applescript</a></p>
    <p>Now I'm going to write a nice beginner css for this html and commit everything to GitHub, then back to work.</p>
