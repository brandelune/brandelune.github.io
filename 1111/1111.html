	<h1>What I need to go deeper into:</h1>
	<ul class="important">
	    <li>css variables</li>
	    <li>media queries</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Basically the two areas that were covered in the two basic tracks that I just completed that did not exist in 96 when I started creating web sites.</p>
	<p>The lessons are here: <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org" target="blank">https://learn.freecodecamp.org</a></p>
	<p>I put two notes in emacs regarding those items, with links to W3Schools, for further reference.</p>
	<p>Here are the links:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp"  target="blank">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp</a></li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp"  target="blank">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp</a></li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp"  target="blank">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>I also need to install some kind of autocompletion for html/css on emacs.</p>
	<p>To create this file, I used my "&lt;text file" applescript that does a "touch" on the front Finder window and proposes to open the created file in Emacs. It used to be BBEdit but I modified that today. I'm putting the script here too.</p>
	<p><a href="./<textfile.html" target="blank">&lt;text file.html</a></p>
	<p>Now I'm going to write a nice beginner css for this html and commit everything to GitHub, then back to work.</p>
