      <description>In one of his most recent albums Lou Reed sings about having a child, I seem to remember, but anyway, at one point he sings "it's the beginning of a great adventure", pretty much what I feel today.</description>

      <description>We use the expression "三日坊主(ミッカボウズ)" (three day monk) in Japan for people who can't commit to something for more than a few days. Hopefully, my #10000daysof code will be longer than that...</description>

      <description>I started learning Chinese in January. I thought my "experience" in learning languages would allow me to do it my way. So I bought a few books and asked a student at the local university to help me with the pronunciation.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I tried this automation that checked the contents of /css and created an html index from the data. I used unix commands, pipes, redirection, sed, and I managed to have something that worked from the command line, but for some reason (escapes maybe?) I could not make it run from a script.</description>

      <description>I'm 49 today. I've been telling anyone who asks "I'm close to 50" just to getting used to say the number. 49 is just another step in that direction. Hopefully, 365 days from now, I'll be working on cool web sites that will make the kids proud. I had two cakes today too.</description>

      <description>Today I had a kendo competition. I have not seriously practiced for close to 2 years. The result was, as I joked on twitter, not "不 (ふ) 動 (どう) 心 (しん) (immovable mind) " but just "不動 ふどう (immovable)".</description>

      <description>I did a lot today. I understand what it means when programmers say "without good comments you can't understand code that you wrote months ago". My code is not complex by any stretch of the imagination, but it took a while to understand again how my emacs lisp templating worked, what was the structure of the project, etc.</description>

      <description>It's a bit heartbreaking to read previous entries and see how happy I was to start something new again, after so many years. Although there are also things I am happy I did, the last few months were a mess.

So, let me make a list of things I can be relatively proud of and of things I really should reflect on.</description>
