	<h1>BBQ</h1>
	<p>BBQ on the hill, with all the friends. Twice a year. Peter was happy about the fact that now we have a new generation of people coming. My brother-in-law was with us, and left in the evening for Tokyo, and then France next Thursday.</p>

	<h2>What I did today</h2>
	<p>Not much time. I fixed the branch merging mess I had done last night. And I added an index for the CSS that I have created so far. No FreeCodeCamp today.</p>
	
	<h2>What I need to do</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li class="todo">Automate the CSS index generation</li>
	    <li class="todo">Automate the <code>todo</code> extraction process</li>
	    <li class="todo">Create an automated index for the readings</li>
	</ul>
