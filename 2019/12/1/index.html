        <p><em>Adventures in Tech Land, Season 2<br />2019/12/01, day 6</em></p>
        <h1>org export</h1>
	<p>Most of the past day was spent on working with the org-mode export. The manual is relatively clear about which options one can use. I added a "UP" link and a "HOME" link (interesting to see that even if you add only one the other is automatically created. I guess that's a bug...)</p>
	<p>I've just been reminded that I'm not automatically in <code>web-mode</code> when I write here. I don't get the end tag completion. I need to add a hook for html files...</p>

	<ul>
	    <li class="todo">add web-mode hook for html files</li>
	    <li class="todo">add options to capture directly to adventuresintechland.org</li>
	    <li class="todo">fix commit message ?</li>
	    <li class="todo">add a "0" to single digit days in the page title</li>
	    <li class="todo">automatically generate "nth day" with a counter</li>
	</ul>
	
        <h2>back to css</h2>   
	<p>I know basic CSS syntax, but I forgot most of the basic properties. I had to do a lot of trial and error, compare with the old css files I had... And doing all this I also modified a lot of things here and there.</p>
	<h2>magit, at last</h2>
	<p>I knew it was preferable to do small commits to make sure modifications were reversable. So I tried to do that, and my current commit list for today's batch is the following:
	    <ul class="magit-output">
		<li><span>d9610b8</span> gh-pages latest org-to-html export</li>
		<li><span>3c2036b</span> add/edit links to today</li>
		<li><span>d23433c</span> sort items in .org file</li>
		<li><span>016ff10</span> removed line breaks in .org file</li>
		<li><span>a1fe0f4</span> FIX dates edge cases...</li>
		<li><span>ecb6812</span> today's template output</li>
		<li><span>c5fd696</span> template  "we're not there yet" -> inside the page</li>
		<li><span>86af1fb</span> new css for the org file export</li>
		<li><span>7fa9f16</span> fix output path creation</li>
		<li><span>a8e9fbe</span> new todo for 12/30 + html export</li>
		<li><span>e51d9c3</span> date formatting error</li>
		<li><span>54bf091</span> add link to todo file</li>
		<li><span>9b73d31</span> add myPreviousDay function for further development</li>
		<li><span>9f99d41</span> rss feed doesn't work</li>
	    </ul>
	    I spent a lot of time in magit, and it was fun. And it's interesting to see how using magit forces me to focus on fixing things little by little, while org-mode helps me register all the things I don't want to fix now. Nice combination of tools. And all that thanks to emacs :)</p>
	<p>I don't know if magit is fun because it <em>is</em> intrinsically fun and easy to use, or because I know enough of git to make sense of it now. I guess it's a little of both.</p>
	<p>Ok, enough for today. I'll be fixing a few bits here and there and then push before starting a nice and sunny Sunday :)</p>
