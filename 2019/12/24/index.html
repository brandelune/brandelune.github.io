        <p>I just got a gas heater in the living room. The house where I live now has no heating system, except for the gas cooker and the water heater. But as far as room heating is concerned, nothing. Until 2 days ago. Now it is considerably easier to stay at the table and work on my stuff. As I did last night, and tonight.</p>
        <h2>css for emacs manuals</h2>
        <p>I've been working on a css for the emacs related manuals. It is just a tweak away in the makefile to get the build process to insert the adequate <code>meta</code> tag, you can even add the line manually for a single page manual, and then write the external css file to have something visually more pleasing. I just committed the one I had been working for, after a few modifications tonight. It is here: <a href="../../../code/emacs.css">emacs.css</a>. I have decided not to modify the texinfo output and just work directly on the original HTML file. It is not the best user experience and my choice of parameters can be questioned, but it is available now and it certainly makes the elisp reference easier for me to read.</p>
