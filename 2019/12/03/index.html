        <h1>Lots of stuff</h1>
        <h2>TODOs...</h2>   
        <p>I worked quite a bit as I see the "DONE" TODOs that I registered.</p>
	<p>First, I fixed the Github issue that I had where I did not see my contributions. It appears that the global git settings were right but not the local ones. I found that in Pro Git, the book that's available from the git site. I'll see if today's push adds green dots to my page!</p>
	<p>Then, I added all the web-mode things that I needed to have. Mostly the hook to html pages, and here again, everything was taken from the web-mode manual that's online.</p>
	<p>I tried to revert something in magit. It was not trivial, and I managed to do that by pushing all sorts of buttons without knowing exactly what I was doing. I'll have to read the book, and the doc and get to understand the concept a bit more before succeeding it seems.</p>
	<p>I moved by emacs preferences from ~/emacs.el to ~/.emacs/d/init.el and I added that to a git repository just in case something goes wrong.</p>
	<p>I also added "auto-completion mode" as advised on the web-mode page. I've been happily auto-completing since. Not yet 100% sure it helps much (especially in the mini-buffer, I don't like the way I copy-paste-configured completion, I'll need to check that.) but I guess time will tell.</p>
	<p>Nothing HTML/CSS/JS related, but I did install RUST, because it was mentioned in a recent video I saw about the next 40 years of emacs, and because a "12 years old developer" who was nice enough to comment on my dev.to post mentioned he was trying it. If an accomplished programmer says it's good for the future of emacs and a 12 years old fellow is interested in the thing, it must be good...</p>
	<p>Last and certainly not least, I went to see a new accountant yesterday and asked her <em>specifically</em> not to do my accounting, but to explain to me how to understand the thing, the way people used to do it by hand back in the days. I also installed ledger, along with the corresponding emacs mode, and I'm close to all set to do the things I need to do...</p>
