	<h1>RSS feed! <a href="https://brandelune.github.io/adventuresintechland.xml"><img src="https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/trademarks/feed-icon-28x28.e077f1f611f0.png" width="15px" height="15px" alt="rss feed" /></a></h1> 
        <p>As I wrote the other day on dev.to (<a href="https://dev.to/brandelune/stop-reading-get-things-done-p2j">here</a>), I've been subscribing to a lot of "web design" and various tech feeds recently. And I thought, why not have my own RSS feed for this wonderful hand-typed web-thing that I'm building at the moment? Today, as I was going to do some freeCodeCamp, I suddenly decided that I wouldn't go to bed before that RSS thing was made and published. I cheated a bit because I've been working in bed since 10pm (almost 2am now), but I'm happy to say that the thing is up and it works. I've loaded it in netNewsWire and I fixed one date error that I spotted (2019 instead of 2018 for a last November post).</p>
	<p>My feed is here: <a href="https://brandelune.github.io/adventuresintechland.xml"><img src="https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/trademarks/feed-icon-28x28.e077f1f611f0.png" width="15px" height="15px" alt="rss feed" /></a> :^)</p>
	    <p>Writing your own RSS feed is trivial. Of course, you're probably writing in an environment where you get RSS for free, but let's pretend you want to write the thing by hand (in emacs?) well, it's pretty easy. Since I registered all the past articles, there was a lot of manually copying urls, and pasting summaries, but now that I only have to do that once per update, I'm probably going to write an elisp script that does it automatically when I finish a post.</p>
	<p>I found one amazing guide to write the xml code: the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_rss.asp">XML RSS w3schools tutorial</a>. Then, there is the <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">RSS official specification</a>, where all the elements are thoroughly explained. The two documents are enough for anything you might need.
	<h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When you use emacs to edit an XML file, it automatically loads the nxml mode. That gives you access to nice shortcuts to edit/close/autocomplete tags. If you don't like to check the help or read the manual in an info buffer, the relevant information is here: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/nxml-mode.html">nXML Mode</a>.</li>
            <li>Now, I just need to not forget to update the feed everyday :^)</li>
